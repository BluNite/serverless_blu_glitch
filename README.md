# Serverless Back-End Proxy For Hiding Weather Api Key and making Api Calls using Node-Fetch with Express Framework.

## Describe

```
Purpose:
protecting data from being viewed on the browser/front-end,
and for making api calls on the back-end. Private API keys should always remain
hidden. A great oppertunity to use Node-Fetch which is fairly new.
This app can also be used for other projects by creating additional routes with Express.

```

## Tecnologies Used

```
- Express
- NodeJS
- Node-Fetch
- CORS
- Open Weather Api
- Express Rate Limit

```
